Phase 1 – Take-home exercise

The purpose of this exercise is to give us an understanding of your capabilities around API and data modelling, and to have a project that we can collaborate on during the on-site portion of the interview. We do this so we have a chance to work together with you on something you’re already familiar with.

Use whatever programming language and framework you’re the most comfortable with.

There’s no time limit, but we’d prefer you don’t spend more than 4-5 hours on it; we’re happy to discuss anything you didn’t get to doing in the on-site portion.

The Project

WE is considering building an app called Puppies. The purpose of this app is for people to be able to share pictures of their dogs, in a style similar to Instagram.
To get this app going, we will need an API to power it; the Puppies API. It’s up to you to build it.

These are the capabilities we’re hoping the full API will eventually have, we’d like to see 4-5 built for this task. Your API might have the ability to:
•	Create a user: They should have a name and an email
•	Authenticate a user (sign in)
•	Create a post: They should have an image, some text content, and a date
•	Like a post
•	Fetch a user’s feed: A list of all posts, ordered by date (newest first)
•	Fetch details of an individual post
•	Fetch a user’s profile
•	Fetch a list of the user’s liked posts
•	Fetch a list of posts the user made

To prove that the API is working, please include some tests to verify critical functionality.

Please provide in the project README:
•	Instructions for project setup:
•	all steps needed to get it running
•	steps for how to run the tests
•	Any highlights or portions you’re particularly happy or proud of
•	Any caveats or limitations of the implementation or design of the API

Feel free to email your recruiter if you have any questions.

Phase 2 – On-site

When you get to the office, we will do a pair programming session on a variety of tasks using the code base that you submitted. Here are some sample things you could expect:  

•	Code walkthrough – walk us through your code and the thinking behind the code. Answer a few questions 
•	Extend your code with a new problem – this gives us an insight into your problem solving skills 

Please bring your own laptop as you will be more successful on a laptop with your own tools. Otherwise, we will work with you on a laptop with Ubuntu Desktop installed in our office.
